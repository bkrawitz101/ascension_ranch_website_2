    short: "A multi-tiered hillside campsite with sweeping views of Folsom Lake and starry nights.",
    description: `High above the valley, where the wind speaks like an old prospector and the horizon wears a crown of blue, Eagle’s Nest reigns.

  Perched at the ranch’s summit like a sentinel from a frontier fable, the overlook reads like a map of legend — vistas of Folsom Lake ripple like molten glass by day and the distant townlights glitter like tacked-on stars by night. Dawn here spills gold into the hollows; dusk draws a hush so deep the coyotes sing softer.

  The site is cut into the hillside in natural terraces: the upper ring is the commons — a stone-lined fire throne, a heavy oak table for tall tales, and the best vantage to watch the sun draw its slow arc. Below, a broad meadow lies ready for tents and wagons, each rimmed by scrub and sky.

  Eagle’s Nest is for the traveler who wants the world underfoot and the illimitable above — a place for private toasts to the horizon and for riders to set out along a secret stretch of the Darrington Trail. Road warns you: this place is earned. Bring a stout rig or a brave pair of boots.`,

    short: "A pastoral campsite where horses may wander by to greet you.",
    description: `Some camps hum. Others hold their breath and listen.

  Hold Your Horses is a pastoral lullaby — a tucked nook in the lower pasture where the tall grass leans in to whisper and the ranch’s mellow herd drifts like drifting clouds. Horses, curious and dignified, will tip their noses into your circle; they are guests and greeters both.

  Wake to the warm thud of hooves and the scent of hay; afternoons fold into lazy shade beneath oak canopies. This ground is for those who prefer their company four-legged and their mornings slow, for folks who like stories told by the land and coffee poured by friends.

  The pasture is private and gentle, a frontier rest stop with easy trail access for boots or saddles — a place to tether a horse, pitch a tent, and let the ranch do the welcoming.`,

    short: "Wide, open meadow perfect for horse rigs and communal camps.",
    description: `Wide as a promise and quiet as an old hymn, Meadow View Equestrian is a page torn from a saddlebag of western myths — where wagon tracks once stitched the grass and riders traded a nod at dusk.

  Drive in, unhitch, and let the meadow claim your workaday weight. Pitch tents or park a long rig; high-line your mounts and you’ll find the windmill called "Lazy Fay" turning like a slow metronome above a stonefire gathering. Evenings here taste of embers and cinnamon coffee.

  Trail gates are close: mornings answer to hooves and the lake is a reachable rumor for day riders. This place favors long conversations, wide circles, and riders who count miles in stories.`,
